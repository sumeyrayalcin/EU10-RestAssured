usages of API
1-connecting application, sharing application between eachother
(fe. skyscanner, logining using gmail)
2-building backend structure with api in single project.
building ui is easy with api.
(fe.in project using the api for amazon has search functionalliy)
'swagger': api dokümanı

What is Rest assured? it is a library that I use for automating API, API test cases.
Because it is a java library and it makes our job easy. (Rest assured: API testing in Java)


SOME POSTMAN FEATURES

We have created global variables to save our baseUrl which is our IPaddress+ port number for spartan so that we can reuse the variable for other requests. in order to call variable in the url inputbox we type {{ and start to type variable name, it will show up and we can pick.

How to edit global variables:

We also saved our request in collection, we click save button then create collection for the first time and saved it. once you have one collection created you can use for saving multiple requstets.

==================================
We use Postman for manually testing, where we verify status code, header, and data inside the body.

we started to use RestAssured library to automate api tests. So far we have learned how to get status code, headers information and do assertion with Junit5 Assertions class. we also verify if json body contains something but we haven't learned yet how to navigate inside the json body


if you wanna learn, please join Tuesday class.
